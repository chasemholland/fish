# Fish-landia

Fish-landia is a game writen in lua and ran with LOVE2D. The goal of the game is to catch every type of fish, whilst fighting off evil slimes. In doing so, the game will end and bring you to a screen that shows off some interesting stats about your playthrough. In addition to catching every type of fish, dying from slimes will also end the game and bring you to a screen that shows the same interesting stats.

## How to get started

You can download the .zip file and extract to a preffered location. Then download and install love2d. Once you have done these two steps, you can simply drag the game file onto the love2d application to start playing.

## Why make this game?

I've spent countless hours getting this game to the point it is at now all because of inspriration from a popular game, Stardew Valley. I really enjoyed the fishing aspect of Stardew Valley and so I decided I would try my hand at making a game that puts more focus on that, while still having a little excitement in the form of combating evil slimes. Though I can't say that this game is anywhere near the level of Stardew Valley, I've learned so much from working on this project and am very proud of what I've accomplished.

## Graphics & Sounds

All of the graphics and sounds are made by myself with the help of a pixel art program called Aseprite and two audio production softwares, FL-Studio and Bfxr. Though I could have found many of the graphics and sound effects for free online that would have sufficed, I decied to do it all myself so that I could dip my hands into every aspect of making a game. In addition to learning a lot with regards to the coding aspect of games, I also have greatly improved in my pixel art and sound creation ability, which at the beging of the project was basically nil.
